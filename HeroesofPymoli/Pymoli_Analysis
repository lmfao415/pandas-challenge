 The first observation from the data is that the vast majority of players are male. They account for 84.03% of the total players and additionally most of the revenue, with $1967.64 of the total $2379.77 coming from male players. Secondly, the 20 to 24 demographic is the highest in terms of overall players as well as purchases and money spent. With the majority of all players being male as well, it can be inferred that the main target audience for advertising should be young men, as the demographics of 15 to 19, 25 to 29, and 30 to 34 are well represented as well. Finally, seeing as the average purchase price is $3.05 and the top spender has only made 5 purchases, this game should be focused on expanding its user base in order to make money. Each player may only make a few purchases for only a few dollars in total revenue per purchase. It would be interesting to see how long each player has played in along with this data, but more players will be needed over time if they are not spending a lot or stop playing.
